## My CSS Custom Style Properties
To start, I removed default margin and padding for a clean slate.  
I used Flexbox to center the component both vertically and horizontally.

In my previous Codex Level 1 CSS class, we briefly learned about `rem` (root em). I revisited my notes and applied `rem` instead of `px` throughout this Level 2 project. In practice, I found that it helped maintain consistent spacing and sizing across my layout for this QR Code assignment.

I also experimented with `vh` (viewport height) to ensure the layout fills the visible screen vertically. I'm looking forward to learning about media quieries that we briefly saw at the end of Week 2 class.

I manually improved my spacing and indentation for better readability on index.html and style.css
